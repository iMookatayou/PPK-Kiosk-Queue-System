This project is a self-service kiosk queue management system for hospitals and clinics. It enables patients to check in using their national ID card or appointment details, automatically generates queue tickets, and displays real-time queue status. The system streamlines patient flow, reduces waiting times, and improves service efficiency by directing patients to the appropriate service counter or department.
